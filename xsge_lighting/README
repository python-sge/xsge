xSGE is a collection of higher-level extensions for the SGE which
enhance the core functionality in an implementation-independent way.
Like the SGE itself, they are distribted under the terms of the GNU
Lesser General Public License.

This extension provides a simple interface for lighting.

INSTALLATION

First, install the dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or later <http://www.python.org>
- Seclusion Game Engine 1.0 or later <https://python-sge.github.io>

Once you have all the dependencies, install this package with the
included setup.py script, e.g. with "python3 setup.py install".

Alternatively, you can just place the "xsge_lighting" folder into the
same directory as the Python program that uses it. This can be a good
idea for the distribution of a game, since it reduces the number of
dependencies the user needs to install.

USAGE

The documentation for this package can be found in the "doc" folder.
