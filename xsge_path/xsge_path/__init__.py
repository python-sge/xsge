    Class for paths: objects which define movement patterns for other

       A list of the points that make up the path relative to the
       position of the path in the room, excluding the first point.
       Each point should be a tuple in the form ``(x, y)``, where x is
       the horizontal location and y is the vertical location.  The
       first point is always ``(0, 0)``, which is why it is not included

        While path objects have a location within the room, this

        Movement is determined relative to the location of the object
        following the path when it started, not the location of the
        path.

        By default, the object follows the path at a constant speed.

        :const:`None`, the object will instead accelerate or decelerate,
        respectively, by that amount each frame on each segment of the
        path.

        ``loop`` indicates the number of times the object should follow
        the path after it does so the first time.  For example, if set
        to ``2``, the object will follow the path a total of 3 times.
