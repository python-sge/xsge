xSGE is a collection of extensions for the SGE licensed under the GNU
General Public License.  They are designed to give additional features
to free/libre software games which aren't necessary, but are nice to
have.

xSGE extensions are not dependent on any particular SGE implementation.
They should work with any implementation that follows the specification.

This extension provides support for loading the JSON format of the
`Tiled Map Editor <http://www.mapeditor.org/>`_.  This allows you to use
Tiled to edit your game's world (e.g. levels), rather than building a
level editor yourself.

INSTALLATION

First, install the dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or later <http://www.python.org>
- Seclusion Game Engine 1.0 or later <https://python-sge.github.io>

Once you have all the dependencies, install this package with the
included setup.py script, e.g. with "python3 setup.py install".

Alternatively, you can just place the "xsge_tiled" folder into the
same directory as the Python program that uses it. This can be a good
idea for the distribution of a game, since it reduces the number of
dependencies the user needs to install.

USAGE

The documentation for this package can be found in the "doc" folder.
