xSGE is a collection of higher-level extensions for the SGE which
enhance the core functionality in an implementation-independent way.
Like the SGE itself, they are distribted under the terms of the GNU
Lesser General Public License.

Each extension is contained in its own sub-directory.  See the
individual directories for more information.

INSTALLATION

First, install the dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or later <http://www.python.org>
- Seclusion Game Engine 1.0 or later <https://python-sge.github.io>

Once you have all the dependencies, install this package with the
included setup.py script, e.g. with "python setup.py install".

The provided setup.py script simply serves as a proxy for using the
setup.py scripts in all sub-directories.  To install only some of these
xSGE extensions, install each one individually with its own setup.py
