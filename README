xSGE is a collection of extensions for the SGE licensed under the GNU
General Public License.  They are designed to give additional features
to free/libre software games which aren't necessary, but are nice to
have.

xSGE extensions are not dependent on any particular SGE implementation.
They should work with any implementation that follows the specification.

Each extension is contained in its own sub-directory.  See the
individual directories for more information.

INSTALLATION

First, install the dependencies:

- Python 3.6 or later <http://www.python.org>
- Seclusion Game Engine 1.0 or later <https://python-sge.github.io>

Once you have all the dependencies, install this package with the
included setup.py script, e.g. with "python setup.py install".

The provided setup.py script simply serves as a proxy for using the
setup.py scripts in all sub-directories.  To install only some of these
xSGE extensions, install each one individually with its own setup.py
